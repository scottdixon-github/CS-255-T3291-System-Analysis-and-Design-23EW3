Briefly summarize the DriverPass project.
Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass application, which is an implementation of an online driving school is the vision of the owner, Liam, who wants to create the instructional application that allows students to sign up, take driving practice exams and eventually pass the driving exam.
The system should allow scheduling appointments over the internet and automatic password reset. Liam wants to be connected to the DMV to stay up to date with changes in their rules and policies.

What did you do particularly well?

I feel that the description of the design was accomplished well. The use of the object and process models allowed me to envision the possible app implementations and constraints that exist in a design of this type.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 

I would revise the UML layout. This was the most difficult aspect of the design.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

When designing a system, it's important to consider the user's needs because ultimately the system is being designed to serve the user. If the system doesn't meet the user's needs, then it won't be effective or useful. To interpret the user's needs, designers need to gather information about the user's requirements, preferences, and limitations. This information can be collected through various methods such as user surveys, interviews, focus groups, and observation. The collected information is then analyzed and used to create user personas, which are detailed descriptions of the characteristics and behaviors of typical users.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Once the user needs have been identified, I can use this information to create the application design. The system should be built in such a way that it is easy to use, meets the user's needs, and is accessible to all users.
